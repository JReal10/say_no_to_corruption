![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8986a847-0649-4cd7-a735-d1cc15fce138)

## Overview
SNTC (Say NO TO CORRUPTION) is a risk assessment tool designed to help identify corruption risks associated with individuals and companies. The application allows users to search for individuals or entities and receive comprehensive risk assessments that include sanctions checks, political exposure screening, adverse media analysis, and high-risk jurisdiction evaluation.

This tool addresses the growing need for enhanced due diligence in business relationships and investment decisions by providing quick, AI-powered risk insights that would typically require extensive manual research across multiple sources.

## Project Description
- Core functionality: Performs comprehensive risk assessments on individuals and companies to identify potential corruption risks
- Target audience: Compliance officers, due diligence professionals, financial institutions, and businesses seeking to evaluate potential partners
- Key features
  - Individual screening for political exposure, sanctions listings, and adverse media
  - Company screening for sanctions, high-risk operations, and sustainability factors
  - Risk assessment summaries with risk ratings and flags
  - Detailed step-by-step analysis of findings
- Problem statement: Manual corruption risk assessment is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often limited by access to reliable data sources
- Solution approach: Leverage Portia.ai's planning and execution capabilities to automate the search and analysis process across multiple data sources and provide structured risk assessments

## How Portia.ai Technology Was Used
- Portia Planning API: Used to create dynamic, structured plans for searching and analyzing information about individuals and companies
- Portia Execution Context: Implemented to manage user sessions and track search operations
- DefaultToolRegistry: Utilized Portia's built-in tool registry, which includes search and data retrieval functionality
- Plan-Based Approach: Each search query generates a multi-step investigation plan that is executed sequentially by Portia
- AI Analysis: Portia's AI capabilities are used to analyze search results, identify risk factors, and generate comprehensive risk assessments in a structured format
